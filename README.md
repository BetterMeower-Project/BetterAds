## Installing on your website

```

## Editing or removing an ad
To edit or remove your ad, please reply to the email we sent you when you submitted your ad. The email address must be the same as the one used to submit. If you cannot reply to the email, simply send an email to adservice@bettermeower.app with any email, but make sure you include the 6 digit security code and BetterAd ID included in the original email.

## How much does it cost? How much can I earn?
We do not charge anything to make ads, neither do we pay out websites using our ad service. We are for promotion of services, not money.
